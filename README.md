# HPC Setup dask-jobqueue
Collection of information that will help you deploy Dask parallel computations on HPC job queuing systems with Jupyterlab interface.

This [tutorial ](hpc.rst) assumes you have access to a HPC system and that you have some basic Unix skills. We'll walk you through some common steps, generally applicable to HPC systems, for securing and simplifying your ssh access using [keys ](keys.rst) and getting Jupyterlab (with Pangeo python ecosystem) or python multicore processing (Dask) running on UMiami HPC system (Triton and Pegasus).
