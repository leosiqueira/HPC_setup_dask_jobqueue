Collection of information that will help you deploy Dask parallel computations on HPC job queuing systems with jupyter notebook interface.

This [tutorial ](hpc.rst) assumes you have access to a HPC system and that you have some basic Unix skills. We'll walk you through some common steps, generally applicable to HPC systems, for simplifying your ssh access using [keys ](keys.rst) and getting Pangeo and or python multicore processing running on UM HPC system (Triton and Pegasus).
